Try adding SDL_AUDIODRIVER=waveout (or alternatively, SDL_AUDIODRIVER=dsound) to your environment (under Windows).

Or, if you're on SDL2 on Windows, you'll need SDL_AUDIODRIVER=directsound or SDL_AUDIODRIVER=winmm â€“ 

It worked fine in Windows 10, after adding to my system an environment Variable named SDL_AUDIODRIVER=directsound .
